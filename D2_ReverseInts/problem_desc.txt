Problem statement:

Implement a class with two methods:

1. A method that takes an integer and outputs the integer in reverse order. For example:

int ReverseInteger(int input)

If you pass input = 12345, the output will be 54321

Ideally the ReverseInteger method should not use any string conversion/manipulation. Instead use mathmatical operators and/or other data structures.

2. A method that takes two integers A and B and returns true if B is the reverse of A. For example:

bool IsReverseInteger(int A, int B)

If you pass A = 12345, B = 54321 the method returns true
If you pass A = 12345, B = 99999 the method returns false

A few hints / things to keep in mind:

1. Think about validating input.
2. Think about testing your implementation.
