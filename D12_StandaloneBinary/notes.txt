Super easy to do in dotnet:

# steps

# ... make a console app ... ie helloworld

shell> dotnet publish -r linux-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained false

# look under bin, you get a 170 KB sort of standalone binary. Its a single file app, that contains all your project but not dotnet runtime.
# or change the self-contained flag to true:


shell> dotnet publish -r linux-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained true
 

# now you get a 60 MB single standalone binary that contains all your app and the runtime. Amazing ....s
