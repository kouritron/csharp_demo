write a C# example daemonized program that generates a random number every hour and saves it under:
/home/user/daemonized_demo

# -------------------- 
# A daemonized program is a long-running background process that provides certain services.
# Ideally a daemonized process should at least (not exahustive):

- Close all open file descriptors.
- Change current working directory.
- Reset the file access creation mask.
- Run in the background.
- Disassociate from process group.
- Ignore terminal I/O signals.
- Disassociate itself from such a thing as controlling terminal.


On linux a double fork strategy is common to achive these. Python has some helper packages.
TODO find a solution for dotnet/C#
